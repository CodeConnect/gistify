# gistify
Hassle free tool that intelligently touches-up and uploads your code snippets. The goal is to enhance a snippet of code with information about the types and origin of objects used within.

### Example

The first part of the [gist](https://gist.github.com/AmadeusW/433b651a5d7d2dfb2261/) is generated by gistify to supplement the snippet selected by the user. The snippet is present in the second part of the gist.
```csharp
// Local:
ObjectInformation objectInfo; // using CodeConnect.Gistify.Extension.CodeAnalysis
Dictionary<String, String> namespacesAndAssemblies; // using System.Collections.Generic
StringBuilder usingStatements; // using System.Text
// Property:
String Namespace; // using System
String AssemblyName; // using System
/* --- */
var name = objectInfo.Namespace;
if (namespacesAndAssemblies.ContainsKey(name))
{
    continue;
}
usingStatements.AppendLine(createUsingStatement(objectInfo));
namespacesAndAssemblies.Add(name, objectInfo.AssemblyName);
```

### Remaining work:

- Integrate with Visual Studio's github plugin (Team Explorer?) so that gists can be automatically uploaded for the logged in user. 
 - ![screenshot](https://i.gyazo.com/15e3f215d7afbe62378fe9012a4bf25e.png)

- Correctly classify the nature of processed identifiers. Currently gistify accepts identifiers that don't need to be processed.
  - In the example above, `Namespace` and `AssemblyName` don't need to be processed, because `objectInfo` was already taken care of.

- Find complete `using` statements for types defined in multiple namespaces, e.g. `Dictionary<StringBuilder, Uri>` needs to have 3 using statements.
